Web development is like an ocean, too many languages, tools, and concepts you need to grasp to become a decent web developer. 

The first time I enter the web development world, I only know that web created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP (and its frameworks). Don't get me wrong, PHP is good and the most used scripting-server language for the web. I did several small projects using PHP while I had an internship, but I didn't like it from the first time. After I getting to know Quora and read several Q&A on Quora which are turn out me to dig deeper about the web, I realize there are some other technologies exist to create the the web beside PHP. 

In order seriously into web technology, I have been planned to learn Python and Django as the main language, in the process, I found an article about Nodejs (libraries of Javascript which is written in C++ and it used to deploys server-side web in Javascript). Then, a question arises in my head, why don't I just learn Javascript and become fullstack developer?. It's easier to learn a language than two or more languages and does the switching of syntax while programming. 

In order to become fullstack Javascript, I need to pick some tools and guess what? Even in Javascript itself, there are so many libraries or frameworks to learn, It is an overwhelming process to determine which tools you should pick first as the beginner. So, this is my roadmap for Javascript web development:

1. Learn the basic Javascript on [freeCodeCamp] and read the first book You Don't Know JS series [Up and Going], if you have more time finish freecodecamp project for your portfolio (I'm prefer doing my own project).

2. Learn how create static front-end using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (jQuery is there to make your life easier, but I recommended you using vanilla JS). 

3. Pick a  JS library (React or Angular), these libraries are written to create the view on single page application (the web that behaves like native apps).

4. Learn Node, Express, and mongodb [Mongodb University]

5. Create a cool project that utilizes all of the stack you have learned.

6. Stay up to date with latest web technology by watch the conferences on youtube, read articles on medium or good blog post, or follows awesome JS developer on twitter.

7. Contribute to an open source project to learn how to build good code base and maintenance large application.

8. Educated other people who have interest in web technology by creates blog or vlog on Youtube.
